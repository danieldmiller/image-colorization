    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Image colourization is about colouring black and while (Grayscale) images. Image Colourization can be characterized into two main categories: Interactive and Automatic colourization. In an interactive method, a user generally maps colour to individual pixel. This method is extremely intensive and prone to human error and the end result is extremely dependent on the user. An automatic method takes in one or several images as inputs and transfer colour from reference to target image. A key challenge in automatic methods is parsing through large amounts of inputs and parameters.</p>
    <p>In this project, we will be implementing image colorization using feature transfer from similar images. This method intends to transfer image colours from one image to another. The constraint of this method is that both images have to be semantically similar. This method uses super pixels of the reference (Input) image, extracts features such as mean intensity, standard deviation, Gabor features and Speed Up Robust features.</p>
